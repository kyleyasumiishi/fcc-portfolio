# freeCodeCamp Portfolio

This is a just-for-fun personal portfolio website I built for one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects. If you're interested, please check out my <a href="https://kyleyasumiishi.github.io/portfolio/">professional portfolio website</a> here!

## About

I built this personal portfolio as one of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects.

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

## New Web Development Concepts Learned

My goal for each freeCodeCamp project is simply to learn about and practice using new web development concepts and techniques.

Here are a few new concepts I learned and practiced by building this project:

- Hosting images in Google Drive using gdurl.com
- Creating tooltips with CSS
- Redefining CSS Grid areas with media queries
- HTML <code>span</code> element

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
